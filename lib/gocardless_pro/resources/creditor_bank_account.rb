  # A module containing classes for each of the resources in the GC Api
  module Resources
    # Represents an instance of a creditor_bank_account resource returned from the API

    # Creditor Bank Accounts hold the bank details of a
    # [creditor](#core-endpoints-creditors). These are the bank accounts which
    # your [payouts](#core-endpoints-payouts) will be sent to.
    #
    # Note that creditor bank accounts must be unique, and so you will encounter
    # a `bank_account_exists` error if you try to create a duplicate bank
    # account. You may wish to handle this by updating the existing record
    # instead, the ID of which will be provided as
    # `links[creditor_bank_account]` in the error response.
