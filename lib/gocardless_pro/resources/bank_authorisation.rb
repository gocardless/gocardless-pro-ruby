  module Resources

    # Bank Authorisations can be used to authorise Billing Requests.

    # account.
    #
    # Creation of Bank Authorisations is only permitted from GoCardless hosted
    # UIs
    # (see Billing Request Flows) to ensure we meet regulatory requirements for
    # checkout flows.
