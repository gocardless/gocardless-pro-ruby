module GoCardlessPro
  # A module containing classes for each of the resources in the GC Api
  module Resources
    # Represents an instance of a customer_bank_account resource returned from the API

    # Customer Bank Accounts hold the bank details of a
    # [customer](#core-endpoints-customers). They always belong to a
    # [customer](#core-endpoints-customers), and may be linked to several Direct
    # Debit [mandates](#core-endpoints-mandates).
    #
    # Note that customer bank accounts must be unique, and so you will encounter
    # a `bank_account_exists` error if you try to create a duplicate bank
    # account. You may wish to handle this by updating the existing record
    # instead, the ID of which will be provided as
    # `links[customer_bank_account]` in the error response.
