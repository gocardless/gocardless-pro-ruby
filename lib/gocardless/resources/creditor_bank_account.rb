  # Creditor Bank Accounts hold the bank details of a
  # [creditor](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#api-endpoints-creditor).
  # These are the bank accounts which your
  # [payouts](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#api-endpoints-payouts) will
  # be sent to.
  # 
  # Note that creditor bank accounts must be unique, and so
  # you will encounter a `bank_account_exists` error if you try to create a
  # duplicate bank account. You may wish to handle this by updating the existing
  # record instead, the ID of which will be provided as
  # `links[creditor_bank_account]` in the error response.
