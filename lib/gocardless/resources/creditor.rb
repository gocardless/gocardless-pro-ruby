  # Each [payment](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#api-endpoints-payments)
  # taken through the API is linked to a "creditor", to whom the payment is then
  # paid out. In most cases your organisation will have a single "creditor", but
  # the API also supports collecting payments on behalf of others.

  # Please get in touch if you wish to use this endpoint. Currently, for Anti
  # Money Laundering reasons, any creditors you add must be directly related to
  # your organisation.
