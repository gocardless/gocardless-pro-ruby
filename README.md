# Ruby Client for GoCardless Enterprise API

- [YARD Docs](http://gocardless.github.io/pro-client-ruby/)
- [GoCardless Pro API Docs](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/)
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/gocardless-pro)

This client is still in beta and is subject to change. Until a stable major version is released you should expect breaking changes.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gocardless-pro'
```

And then load it into your application:

```ruby
require 'gocardless-pro'
```

## Usage Examples

- In the case of a single response, the client will return you an instance of the resource
- In the case of list responses, the client will return an instance of `ListResponse`, which is enumerable.
- You can also call `#all` to get a lazily paginated list of resource that will deal with making extra API requests to paginate through all the data

### Initialising the client

The client is initialised with the API Key ID and the API Key `key` property.

You can also pass in `environment` as `:sandbox` to make requests to the sandbox environment rather than the live one.

```rb
@client = GoCardless::Client.new(
  api_key: ENV["GOCARDLESS_API_ID"],
  api_secret: ENV["GOCARDLESS_API_KEY"]
)
```

### GET requests

You can make a request to get a list of resources using the `list` method:

```rb
@client.customers.list
```

This README will use `customers` throughout but each of the resources in the API is available in this library. They are defined in [`gocardless.rb`](https://github.com/gocardless/pro-client-ruby/blob/master/lib/gocardless-pro.rb#L87).

If you need to pass any options, the last (or in the absence of URL params, the only) argument is an options hash. This is used to pass query parameters for `GET` requests:

```rb
@client.customers.list(limit: 400)
```

A call to `list` returns an instance of `GoCardless::ListResponse`. This is a enumerable which lets you iterate over every item returned:

```rb
@client.customers.list do |customer|
  p customer.given_name
end
```

In the case where a url parameter is needed, the method signature will contain required arguments:

```rb
@client.customers.get(customers_id)
```

As with list, the last argument can be an options hash:

```rb
@client.customers.get(customers_id, limit: 200)
```

### POST/PUT Requests

For POST and PUT requests you need to pass in the body in as the last argument.

```rb
@client.customers.create(
  first_name: "Pete",
  last_name: "Hamilton",
  ...
)
```

As with GET requests, if any parameters are required they come first:

```rb
@client.customers.update(customer_id, {...})
```

### Custom Headers

If you need to pass in a custom header to an endpoint, you can pass in a separate hash as the last argument:

```rb
@client.helpers.mandate({
  account_number: 200000,
  ...
}, {
  'Accept': 'application/pdf'
})
```

There are very few endpoints in the API that require custom headers. Currently, the only ones that do are [helpers](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#api-endpoints-helpers).

### Handling failures

When an API returns an error, the client __will raise__ an error that corresponds to the type of error. All errors subclass `GoCardless::Error`. There are four errors that could be thrown:

- `GoCardless::GoCardlessError`
- `GoCardless::InvalidApiUsageError`
- `GoCardless::InvalidStateError`
- `GoCardless::ValidationError`

These errors are fully documented in the [API documentation](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#overview-errors).

The error has the following methods to allow you to access the information from the API response:

- `#documentation_url`
- `#message`
- `#type`
- `#code`
- `#request_id`
- `#errors`

## Supporting Ruby < 2.0.0
The client only supports Ruby >= 2.0.0 out of the box due to our use of
Enumerable::Lazy for lazy loading of paginated API resources.

However, support for previous ruby versions can be added using a gem such as
[backports](https://github.com/marcandre/backports).

1. Add backports to your Gemfile
   ```gem 'backports'```
2. Require lazy enumerables
   ```require 'backports/2.0.0/enumerable/lazy.rb'```

## Contributing

This client is auto-generated from Crank, a toolchain that we hope to soon open source. Issues should for now be reported on this repository. __Please do not modify the source code yourself, your changes will be overriden!__
